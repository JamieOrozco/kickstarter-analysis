# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the data from a Kickstarter campaign. The client wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The key benefit of this analysis is to uncover trends to successful funding goals. The analysis will evaluate the best months and their goals. The data set included eight years with nine parent categories. We have analyzed, Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date. This comparison will show the months the theatre category failed, succeeded or canceled. We have also analyzed, Outcomes Based on Goals. This comparison will show Play category goals against the percentage failed, successful, and canceled. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date analysis shows that there were far more successful campaigns that unsuccessful ones. The most successful launch month was May there was a sharp decline in successful campaigns from November to December. This data suggests that December is the worst month for launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Theater category.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The goal analysis shows us that there is a higher likelihood of success if the fundraising goal is under $5,000. The highest percentage of success at 76% were goals under $1,000. The $15,000-$19,999 mark is the range that starts to have 50% likelihood of success.
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A difficulty I encountered was adjusting the COUNTIFs function throughout the rows and columns. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The launch date analysis shows that the most successful launch month was May and that there was a sharp decline between November and December. This tells us the best time to launch a Theatre Kickstarter campaign is in May. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The funding goal has an impact of the success of the kickstarted campaign. Anything over $20,000 has a very high likelihood of failing. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset might have other factors that were important to determine the success of the Kickstarter project.  A few possible challenges encountered is the accuracy of the data set. There are different types of currencies. This should be standardized. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I think there could also be analysis based on backerâ€™s count. Does the number of backers affect the goal being met?
